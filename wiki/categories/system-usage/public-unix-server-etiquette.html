    <h2>public unix server etiquette</h2>

    <p>A public Unix server is usually a computer that someone is volunteering to share with other
    people. The maintenance of the computer requires time, keeping the computer on the internet and
    accessible to users costs money and resources, such as RAM, CPU, and storage space are
    limited.</p>

    <p>This document provides a list of recommendations for people who use public Unix servers.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not assume gender. If you don't know someone's pronouns, ask them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not pirate data. Regardless of your politics on piracy, you are putting the owner of the public
        Unix server at risk, because it is them who is being seen on the outside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid hogging resources such as RAM, CPU, and storage space on your public Unix server. This is
        unfair for other users, and is also at the expense of the public Unix server's owner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not mine cryptocurrency. This hogs system resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid downloading as best as you can. The public Unix server's owner has to pay bills for your
        bandwidth usage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not post chat messages publicly without permission. Some people rant and fume, and don't want
        their messages being displayed publicly. It could cost them their job.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not call the police in case of a suicide mention.
      </li>
    </ul>
